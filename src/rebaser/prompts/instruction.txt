I have a series of commits in a fork that introduced 8 files and modified three others.
Most of these commits are me learning as I went and are not appropriate to be merged upstream in a pull request.
Analyze the following commit history and come up with a detailed plan for rebasing the fork history including which commits to drop, reword, squash, etc.
Return a list of git commands to perform in order to rebase the fork into as few commits as possible in preparation for the fork to be merged upstream in a pull request. Only provide a new commit message if the git command is reword.
Verify that this commit rebase will not result in any merge conflicts and will result in the same final files before sending your answer.
